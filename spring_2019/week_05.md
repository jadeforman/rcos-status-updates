Spring 2019
Week 5
FLOM

Last Week’s Accomplishments:

We began the process to enable remote access to the rapsberrypi but we ran into a few issues such with static IP and port forwarding.  So instead we plan on developing code for the embedded system only in C or C++ (it has not been decided just yet.)
    
This Week’s Plan:
This week I plan to help the hardware team on developing the code for the hardware and also continue benchmarking for our sensor choice and committing it to the Git.  Also, I will be working on building the housing that will enclose the hardware in the actual room.  I will be creating CAD to show the shapes, dimensionsions, etc that will be necessary to fit all the hardware components and keep them safe in the ceiling.  Hopefully I can then mold the shape in the MILL and have a prototype by the end of the semester.

Anything Blocking?:
Nothing blocking us for the next few weeks.
