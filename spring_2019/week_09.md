Last Weekâ€™s Accomplishments:
Last week we got the sensors working and talking with the web app that the software team has created.  We tested it in the actual library to prove that it will work.  We placed the hardware in a study room ad logged onto the web app.  We were on the 3rd floor to we went tot eh 3rd floor page on the web app and it showed that there was someone in the room and that it was occupied!  We then had the person leave the room, we refreshed the web page and it showed that the room was now vacant.  This will be shown in our final presentation.  We have also decided on putting the hardware in the ceiling.  Since the library's ceiling is paneled, we are just going to make a tiny cutout in one of the panels in the center of the room and have the sensor dangle down a tiny bit so it can see the room and we will use a tiny dome to cover it to keep it safe and secure using thermally transparent material.  Diagrams have been comitted to the Git.

This Week's Plan:
This week we have been working on the final presentation that we have on Friday and have been filling in the powerpoint we created for the presentation and dividing up the slides.  The team has worked so hard this semester and it's super exciting that we have a working web app and working hardware that is connected to the web app.  In the presentation there is a video of us demo'ing our work this semester and we are really excited to present it!
