Week 8
FLOM

Last Weekâ€™s Accomplishments:
So we got the new sensor in so we were able to continue our testing for the hardware design aspect of the project.  The team met on Sunday night to try and set up the sensor and get it sending a signal to the Raspberry Pi.  After a lot of frustration, the team has finally got the sensor working!  This week, I also began doing some research on thermally transparent material for the housing of the hardware. I have drawn up a few different sketches for the housing and we are still discussing where the best place would be to put the device in the study room to maximize our results and have accurate results.  I will be posting my results and sketches in the Git soon once they are finalized. We started considering a design change, but soon found out that the sensor we are using is not compatible with Arduinos.  Are idea was that because we have been having so many issues getting the two devices to talk with each other, we were conisdering adding another component to the design.  We were thinking that we might have to run an intermediate arduino between the two Pi's, but quickly realized this was not viable.
This Week's Plan:
This week I will be speaking with Professor Chiappone from the MILL to talk about 3D printing a mock-up of the hardware housing and speak with him more about materials that would be best to use to protect the hardware but also avoid any interferances.  We will continue working with the sensor and RPi to get them communicating with each other begin writing code to parse the data we retreive and work collaboratively with the software team to begin bringing the project all together. 

Anything Blocking?:
Nothing blocking us from now on!
