Week 8
FLOM

Last Weekâ€™s Accomplishments:
So we got the new sensor in so we were able to continue our testing for the hardware design aspect of the project.  The team met on Sunday night to try and set up the sensor and get it sending a signal to the Raspberry Pi.  This week, I also began doing some research on thermally transparent material for the housing of the hardware. I have drawn up a few different sketches for the housing and we are still discussing where the best place would be to put the device in the study room to maximize our results and have accurate results.  I will be posting my results and sketches in the Git soon once they are finalized.

This Week's Plan:
This week I will be speaking with Professor Chiappone to talk about 3D printing a mock-up of the hardware housing and speak with him more about materials that would be best to use to protect the hardware but also avoid any interferances.  We will continue working with the sensor and RPi to get them communicating with each other and also will be going over a little bit of a design change.  Because we have been having so many issues getting the two devices to talk with each other, we are conisdering adding anotehr component to the design.  We are thinking that we might have to run an intermediate arduino between the two Pi's.  This is something being discussed and may be implemented in the near future.

Anything Blocking?:
Nothing blocking us from now on!
