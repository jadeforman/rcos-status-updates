Spring 2019
Week 10
FLOM

Last Weekâ€™s Accomplishments:
Last week we presented our final presentation to Professor Turner. We have officially completed all our milestones that we have set for ourselves this semester in our preliminary proposal!
    
This Week's Plan:
Since we are pretty much done, for the rest of the semester we will get all our commits into the Git and begin documenting future plans for the project that we think would be good to change or add to make the project better and more advanced. Any ideas we come up with for future teams we will commit into the Git so others can see.  Some ideas the hardware team has is implementing a timer system.  We notice that people like to leave their stuff in the room and go to class to save the room for themselves after.  We think this is unfair so we think implementing a timer sysem would help solve this problem a little bit.  The idea is that, if someone needs to use the bathroom or print something they can press a little push button that will start a 5 minute timer which enures their room will stay occupied on the website.  Once the 5 minutes is up the room will turn green and be considered unoccupied.  This is 1 of many different ideas we have for future teams who may want to work on FLOM.

Anything Blocking?:
Nothing!
