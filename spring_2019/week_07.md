RCOS Status Update
Spring 2019
Week 7
FLOM

Last Week’s Accomplishments:
This week I spent most of my time catching up on what the team was able to complete the week I was out due to my concussion. The team met Thursday night in the IoT lab in the JEC to continue testing our IR sensor and getting it to communicate with the RPi.  Unfortunately, we some how broke the sensor and had to order a new one that night which is delaying our prototype a few days. 

This Week’s Plan:
This coming week we will be getting our new sensor in the mail so we can continue testing our prototype and writing the code for the RPi.  The software team has completed a lot by now and will be handing off some of their workers over to help the hardware team with developing code for the RPi.  Hopefully with the new help we can get pretty far the next couple of weeks.  We will also be working on our 10 min presentation that is due next Friday.

Anything Blocking?:
The only thing blocking us right now is the broken sensor. The new one comes in Sunday so we can continue our testing then.
