Week 2
FLOM

Last Week’s Accomplishments:
So, I was sick all this week and had 3 exams so I am a little behind on schedule.  But I do know that the hardware team’s parts came in today, 2/15 so we are ready to start building.  We had ordered a RasberryPi and a few different types of sensors to test which ones we think work best.  The software team is moving ahead nicely with the framework.  They finished the Django framework tutorial and are ready to continue working on the development of the website.

This Week’s Plan:
Now that the hardware has been delivered, we plan to begin working at building the sensor system with accompanying circuit boards and C code.  We will be working on wiring the circuits and doing different circuit simulations to ensure nothing blows up or goes wrong.

Anything Blocking?:
Now that we have received the parts we can begin building so I do not see anything blocking us in the next few weeks as of right now.
