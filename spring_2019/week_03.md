Week 3
FLOM

Last Week’s Accomplishments:
Last week we finally got all our parts in so we slowly began to play around with them and research how we plan to integrate all our parts together. Specifically for me, I did some integrated circuit research and research on how to use a RaspberryPi.  Liam McBain, who is head of the hardware team is very knowledgeable about RPi's its associated code so I am excited to learn from him and get this hardware set up.

This Week’s Plan
This week we plan to meet outside of class to begin the hardware development.  Liam and I both have access to the IoT lab in the JEC so we plan to do most of our work in there because there is available equipment in that room for us to use. (Examples of equipment include things like HDMI cords/displays and USB keyboards.)  We will continue researching how to implement this sensor system and begin trying to put all the pieces together and get it working.

Anything Blocking?:
Now that all our parts are in, we see nothing blocking our work in the near future.
