RCOS Status Update
Spring 2019
Week 4
FLOM

Last Week’s Accomplishments:
This week we met outside of class and began testing all the hardware that we ordered.  We worked in the IoT lab in JEC and hooked up our RaspberryPi to the monitors and hooked it up to the WiFi.  We were able to wire it to the sensor and get a few readings from the RapsberryPi to the monitor.
    
This Week’s Plan:
This week we plan on working on enabling remote access to the RaspberryPi and begin developing code for the embedded development.

Anything Blocking?:
Only thing blocking is that we have off next week so I presume no one will be working on their parts that week and enjoying their time off.
